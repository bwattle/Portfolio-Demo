# Portfolio for Your Name
The website for this site can be viewed at: https://bwattle.github.io/Portfolio/ (you will need to replace this link)

This website displays my work over the 2 years of IPT as well as my skill with web building.

In fact, this one doesn't as it's the template site for students at Blackwattle Bay and anyone else who wants to use it. It's hoped that it's a simple version of a site which will work on Mobile and Desktop. The code can look complex at first, but make small changes and test, test test!!
